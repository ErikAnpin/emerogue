# CHANGELOG

4/11/2024 
- Merged yet another poison puppeteer stuff + mortal spin (kinda? I can't find it on eevee's repo)
- Buffed the reward for the multiplier

3/11/2024
- Merged eevee's poison puppeteer related things + minor fixes
- Added quick route option for... Quicker routes. Since making a shorter run isn't an option due to how the game expects you to defeat 14 mighty trainers, rip. It doesn't affect existing generated map however, and instead will be enforced on the next map generation
- Fixed venipede's funny overworld look

2/11/2024
- Fixed weird berrytag ui behavior
- Added popups for Pick Up, Honey Gatherer, and Shuckle's berry juice
- Added a new route, quick map, for debugging purposes
- Fixed the conditional, pecharunt should be able to spawn now

1/11/2024
- Added quick brewing
- Fixed sylveon evo
- Merged some fixes from EggsOverEevee, such as the thermal change fix, double snowscape alolan ninetales fix, and galarian birds

28/10/2024
- Optimized the difficulty reward code in the menu
- Added an indicator for pokemon spawns left for the catching contest in the pause menu
- Added quick sell/drop toggle in bag, activated by start 

27/10/2024
- Fixed the honey tree for good. Sorry.
- Adjusted the saveblock2. Thank you kleenex
- Ridemon that can swim shouldn't jump off the cliff or the bridge onto the land. Seems to be an unintended behavior because I don't notice this problem on other ridemons
- Adjusted the full rest stop map a little
- Added a countdown for the catching contest
- Added an option to show money in start menu

23/10/2024
- Curses bonus included in the multiplier. Each unstackable Curse adds +0.2x, while each stackable Curse adds +0.1x at 1, +0.2x at 2, and +0.3x at 3 or more

22/10/2024
- Custom settings for some of my features are added, in case you'd rather keep vanilla system.  Currently includes the new difficulty reward system and ridemon control
- Reward is now scaled off the multiplier if you have the new difficulty reward system on
- Adjusted more stuff, now difficulty reward should also affect rewards you can claim. Color coded similarly to the vanilla system

21/10/2024:
- One liner issue should be fixed now
- Minor fix to the honey tree
- Difficulty setting is now multiplier based, it should be more modular now.

10/10/2024:
- Berry blender NPC added into the daycare and full rest stop
- You can no longer jump off the cliff/bridge if your mon can swim while riding it.
- Added a proper flag for the pokeball changer NPC and the conditions.
- Unique mon tracker countdown is back

8/10/2024:
- Pokeblock can now be scattered by directly interacting on the Honey Tree
- Press R to fly instead of B, now you can only cycle with L
- Talk to your mon to ride it, press B to dismount. Need basic whistle. You can cycle through your party with it as well. It does not change the order of the mon on your party, and you still need the golden whistle if you want to access your daycare mons.
- You can now change your mon's pokeball via an NPC in the town square after buying the school upgrade (might change in the future?)
