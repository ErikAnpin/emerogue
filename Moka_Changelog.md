# CHANGELOG

27/10/2024
- Fixed the honey tree for good. Sorry.
- Adjusted the saveblock2. Thank you kleenex
- Ridemon that can swim shouldn't jump off the cliff or the bridge onto the land. Seems to be an unintended behavior because I don't notice this problem on other ridemons

23/10/2024
- Curses bonus included in the multiplier. Each unstackable Curse adds +0.2x, while each stackable Curse adds +0.1x at 1, +0.2x at 2, and +0.25x at 3 or more

22/10/2024
- Custom settings for some of my features are added, in case you'd rather keep vanilla system.  Currently includes the new difficulty reward system and ridemon control
- Reward is now scaled off the multiplier if you have the new difficulty reward system on
- Adjusted more stuff, now difficulty reward should also affect rewards you can claim. Color coded similarly to the vanilla system

21/10/2024:
- One liner issue should be fixed now
- Minor fix to the honey tree
- Difficulty setting is now multiplier based, it should be more modular now.

10/10/2024:
- Berry blender NPC added into the daycare and full rest stop
- You can no longer jump off the cliff/bridge if your mon can swim while riding it.
- Added a proper flag for the pokeball changer NPC and the conditions.
- Unique mon tracker countdown is back

8/10/2024:
- Pokeblock can now be scattered by directly interacting on the Honey Tree
- Press R to fly instead of B, now you can only cycle with L
- Talk to your mon to ride it, press B to dismount. Need basic whistle. You can cycle through your party with it as well. It does not change the order of the mon on your party, and you still need the golden whistle if you want to access your daycare mons.
- You can now change your mon's pokeball via an NPC in the town square after buying the school upgrade (might change in the future?)
