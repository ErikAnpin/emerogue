# QnA
[Changelog here](https://github.com/DepressoMocha/emerogue/blob/moka-dev/Moka_Changelog.md)

Q: Is my save compatible with this one? Do I have to restart?
A: The save should be compatible with the other patch or vanilla as long as you don't have the pocket PC. Don't save in the quick route though.

Q: What the hell is quick route?
A: It's, well, a map designed so that you can just press up to progress, lol. It's really nothing special, as I made it so that I can rush the game as quickly as possible during debugging. Added it in anyway so I can have a somewhat quicker run. It's generated once you enter the run/earn a badge, so keep that in mind.

Q: What's the difference between ridemon control vanilla and mocha?
A: Vanilla is the same control as you probably used to. Mocha changed the fly button to R button, and B for quick dismount

Q: Why it's only EX :(
A: I don't play classic version, and honestly it's a hassle to compile two versions

Q: Why should I get this one over the other version when both has similar features anyway?
A: I don't know lol. I made this (mostly) for myself, after all. I update it pretty frequently though (which may or may not be a good thing)

Q: Where do I download the latest patch? It's not in release??
A: [In my drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CeyNH54nBwguvLIN50Ucx3Wk6K9_abVl). Again, I update it pretty frequently, and I think drive is easier to update

Q: Why is mocha everywhere... Are you self centered? Do you like mocha??
A: I am just creatively inept
